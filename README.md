<h4 align="center">A web app to manage all your calendars in one place.</h4>

## About
Scheduler allows the user to add their events to the calendar and access them anywhere, anytime. The users can choose to follow some public calendars too. The events posted by the public calendars are visible to the user in their own calendar. Note that to make a public calender, one has to register as a 'Channel'. All user calendars are private and all channel calendars are public.

The frontend is built using Reactjs and is deployed [here](http://basic-scheduler.herokuapp.com/) using Heroku. The backend repo can be found [here](https://github.com/bhagwatgarg/scheduler-backend).
